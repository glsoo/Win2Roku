❗ Notes
	•	Make sure your firewall allows the Win2Roku EXE to serve on your local network
	•	This app is designed for LAN streaming only — no port forwarding is required
	•	Port forwarding can work if you configure your router, but it is not recommended
	•	Stream latency will depend on your PC’s performance and network quality

💡 Future improvements
	•	Auto-detect stream on LAN
	•	Stream quality adjustment options
	•	Custom on-screen keyboard for full URL or domain entry
